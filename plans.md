# CNC Panel Development Plans

## Completed Features ✅

### Phase 1: Basic Connection and Status
- ✅ Web Serial API implementation
- ✅ Connection management with error handling
- ✅ Real-time status monitoring
- ✅ Auto-connection to previously paired devices
- ✅ Communication logging with copy functionality

### Phase 2: Manual Controls
- ✅ Basic jog controls (X/Y/Z axes)
- ✅ **Advanced tap/hold jogging**:
  - ✅ Tap for stepped movement
  - ✅ Hold for continuous movement
  - ✅ Proper jog cancel implementation
- ✅ Configurable step sizes (0.1mm, 1mm, 10mm)
- ✅ Touch support for mobile devices
- ✅ Homing operations (all axes and individual)
- ✅ **Removed software emergency stop** (hardware e-stop is safer and more reliable)

### Phase 3: Work Coordinate System
- ✅ Enhanced position display (MPos and WPos)
- ✅ Work coordinate zero setting (individual and combined axes)
- ✅ WCO (Work Coordinate Offset) parsing and calculation
- ✅ Auto-detection of existing work coordinate offsets
- ✅ Safe navigation to work/machine coordinates
- ✅ Removed confirmation dialogs for faster workflow

### Phase 4: Activity Detection and Status Updates
- ✅ High-frequency status polling during activity (20Hz)
- ✅ 2-second settling time after jogging stops
- ✅ Detection of external activity (built-in controller)
- ✅ Command tracking to distinguish internal vs external commands

## Current Status

The CNC panel now provides professional-grade manual control functionality with:
- **Professional jogging behavior**: Tap for precision, hold for positioning
- **Real-time position feedback**: Both machine and work coordinates
- **Intelligent activity detection**: Responds to both web and built-in controller usage
- **Fast workflow**: No confirmation dialogs, immediate zero setting

## Next Development Priorities

### Phase 5: Feed Rate and Overrides
- [ ] Real-time feed rate override controls (10-200%)
- [ ] Spindle speed override controls  
- [ ] Rapid rate override controls
- [ ] Display current override percentages

### Phase 6: Spindle Control
- [ ] Spindle start/stop control
- [ ] Spindle speed setting (RPM)
- [ ] Spindle direction control (CW/CCW)
- [ ] Coolant control (if applicable)

### Phase 7: G-code File Handling
- [ ] G-code file upload and parsing
- [ ] G-code preview and validation
- [ ] Job execution with start/stop/pause controls
- [ ] Progress tracking and time estimation
- [ ] Job queue management

### Phase 8: Probing and Tool Management
- [ ] Probe connectivity detection
- [ ] Tool length measurement workflows
- [ ] Workpiece probing (corner finding, surface detection)
- [ ] Tool change procedures
- [ ] Tool library management

### Phase 9: Advanced Features
- [ ] Macro system for common operations
- [ ] Job templates and presets
- [ ] Machine configuration backup/restore
- [ ] Performance logging and analytics

### Phase 10: Panel Mode
- [ ] Kiosk/fullscreen mode for dedicated panel use
- [ ] Large button interfaces for workshop environment
- [ ] Simplified operator interface
- [ ] Multi-user access controls

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for all Grbl error codes
- [ ] Implement unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Add TypeScript for better type safety
- [ ] Code documentation and inline comments

### User Experience
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- [ ] Customizable interface layouts
- [ ] Dark/light theme options
- [ ] Multi-language support

### Performance
- [ ] Optimize status polling algorithms
- [ ] Implement efficient G-code parsing
- [ ] Add caching for frequently used data
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

## Architecture Decisions

### Current Approach
- **Framework-free**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript for simplicity and performance
- **Direct Web Serial**: No middleware or servers required for CNC communication
- **Real-time updates**: Event-driven status monitoring
- **Mobile-first**: Touch-friendly interface design

### Future Considerations
- **PWA features**: Offline capability, app-like experience
- **WebRTC**: Potential for remote operation over networks
- **WebAssembly**: For complex G-code processing if needed
- **Service Workers**: For background task management

## Safety and Reliability

### Implemented Safety Features
- ✅ Connection state validation before commands
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Safe coordinate system operations
- ✅ **Reliance on hardware emergency stop** for maximum safety

### Planned Safety Enhancements
- [ ] Soft limits enforcement
- [ ] Travel boundary visualization
- [ ] Collision detection warnings
- [ ] Safe height management for tool changes
- [ ] Automatic recovery procedures

**Safety Philosophy**: This software intentionally does not implement a software emergency stop, as hardware-based emergency stops are significantly more reliable and faster. Always ensure your CNC machine's hardware emergency stop is functional and easily accessible during operation.
