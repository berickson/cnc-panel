plans are in plans.md, this should be kept up to date
you should mark items as completed only after I have confirmed they are done
README.md should also be kept up to date, and SHOULD NOT include plans, only instructions and as-built information
in js code, all functions and variables should be snake_case
html elements should asl be snake_case, use full names, like "submit_button"
2 spaces for indentation in html, js, and css
braces on the same line as the function or control statement
check with me for decisions on behavior
